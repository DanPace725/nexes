# Next 5 Steps - Revised Practical Approach

## Current Status âœ…
- [x] GitHub repo initialized
- [x] Rocket.Chat cloned and MongoDB running
- [x] Basic nexes project structure created
- [x] Documentation complete and comprehensive

## Revised Next 5 Steps

### Step 1: Build ORMD Parser & Validator ðŸŽ¯
**Goal:** Create the core data format that everything else depends on

**Actions:**
- Create `packages/ormd-parser/` package
- Implement YAML frontmatter parsing
- Build ContextBundle JSON schema validation
- Add TypeScript types for all ORMD structures
- Create basic CLI tool for validating ORMD files

**Success:** Can parse and validate ORMD documents from the docs/ folder

### Step 2: Create Context Bundle Storage
**Goal:** Implement the data layer for context preservation

**Actions:**
- Create `packages/context-storage/` package  
- Set up PouchDB for local-first storage
- Implement ContextBundle CRUD operations
- Add lineage tracking functionality
- Build simple query interface

**Success:** Can store, retrieve, and link ContextBundles with lineage

### Step 3: Build Minimal Chat Interface
**Goal:** Create a simple web interface to test context preservation

**Actions:**
- Create `apps/chat-prototype/` web app
- Build basic HTML/CSS/JS chat interface
- Integrate context storage from Step 2
- Add ORMD export functionality
- Implement simple "conversation memory"

**Success:** Can have a conversation that preserves context and exports to ORMD

### Step 4: Add AI Integration
**Goal:** Get one AI model responding with context awareness

**Actions:**
- Integrate OpenRouter API for model access
- Add AI response generation with context
- Implement uncertainty indicators in responses
- Create simple `/ai @claude` command interface
- Ensure AI responses generate proper ContextBundles

**Success:** Can have context-aware conversations with Claude

### Step 5: Implement Obsidian Export
**Goal:** Bridge to existing knowledge management tools

**Actions:**
- Create Obsidian-compatible file export
- Generate proper markdown with preserved metadata
- Build folder structure for vault organization
- Add bidirectional sync capabilities (basic)
- Test with real Obsidian vault

**Success:** Conversations export cleanly to Obsidian with full context

## Why This Approach Works

1. **Incremental Value**: Each step produces something demonstrable
2. **Core-First**: Builds the ORMD foundation everything else needs
3. **Avoids Complexity**: Sidesteps Rocket.Chat integration issues for now
4. **Testable**: Each step has clear success criteria
5. **Flexible**: Can pivot to Rocket.Chat integration later when core is solid

## Estimated Timeline
- **Step 1**: 2-3 days (ORMD parser is well-specified)
- **Step 2**: 2-3 days (PouchDB is straightforward)  
- **Step 3**: 3-4 days (Basic web interface)
- **Step 4**: 2-3 days (OpenRouter integration)
- **Step 5**: 2-3 days (File export is well-defined)

**Total**: ~2 weeks of focused development

## After Step 5
Once we have a working prototype with all core functionality:
- Revisit Rocket.Chat integration (may be easier to build plugin)
- Add more sophisticated AI orchestration
- Implement federation protocols
- Scale up the user interface

This approach gets us to a **working MVP faster** while building the right foundations.
