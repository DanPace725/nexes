# Nexes Development Setup Guide

## Current Status
- ✅ Rocket.Chat repository cloned
- ✅ Docker installed and working
- ✅ MongoDB running in Docker
- ⚠️ Node.js version mismatch (have 22.13.1, need 22.16.0)
- ✅ Yarn 4.9.3 installed (correct version)

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Use Docker Development Environment
Since we have Docker working, we can use it to bypass the Node version issue:

1. **MongoDB is already running** ✅
2. **Build Rocket.Chat in Docker container** (bypasses Node version)
3. **Mount source code for development**

### Option 2: Install Correct Node Version
Use a Node version manager to install the exact required version:

```bash
# Using nvm (if available)
nvm install 22.16.0
nvm use 22.16.0

# Or using volta (if available)
volta install node@22.16.0
```

### Option 3: Modify Engine Requirements (Temporary)
Temporarily modify package.json to allow current Node version for development.

## Current Environment
- **OS**: Windows 10.0.26100
- **Node**: v22.13.1 (need 22.16.0)
- **Yarn**: 4.9.3 ✅
- **Docker**: 28.4.0 ✅
- **MongoDB**: Running in Docker ✅

## Next Actions
1. Try Docker-based development approach
2. If that fails, install correct Node version
3. Get basic Rocket.Chat running
4. Start implementing ORMD integration
