# E² Ethos Document Bundle

This directory contains the foundational documents that define the ethos, principles, and implementation plan for the E² (Essence of Existence) relational intelligence project.

## Document Overview

The documents are designed to be read in sequence, following the **Exposure Protocol** pattern of Invitation → Structure → Integration → Demonstration:

### 1. Foundational Ethos (Invitation)
**File:** `01_foundational_ethos.ormd`

The constitution and core values that define why this project exists. Introduces the E² core postulate that "everything exists in relationship" and establishes our four core values: Coherence, Adaptation, Stewardship, and Resilience.

### 2. Design Axioms & Guardrails (Structure I)
**File:** `02_design_axioms_guardrails.ormd`

The non-negotiable design principles that ensure systems remain coherent under pressure. Covers the Temporal Compression Law, Boundary Protocol, CLP Principles, and AOMI defenses against gaming.

### 3. Protocol Reference (Structure II)
**File:** `03_protocol_reference.ormd`

The operational playbook for implementing coherent human-AI interaction. Details the Exposure Protocol loop, RNT micro-protocols for empathy scaling, and failure recovery heuristics.

### 4. Data & Artifact Specification (Structure III)
**File:** `04_data_artifact_specification.ormd`

Technical specifications for data formats and schemas that enable coherent knowledge flow. Defines ORMD format, ContextBundle schema, and interoperability standards.

### 5. MVP Playbook (Integration)
**File:** `05_mvp_playbook.ormd`

The pragmatic implementation plan for building the vision into reality. Includes roadmap phases, technology stack, user journeys, and success criteria.

### 6. Relational Compass (Demonstration)
**File:** `06_relational_compass.ormd`

The poetic expression of our ethos and the compass for navigating ethical complexity. Provides the "soul check" and daily practices for staying aligned with our values.

## Document Format

All documents use the **ORMD (Organizational Relational Markdown)** format with structured metadata that preserves context and lineage. Each document includes:

- **Context lineage** tracking derivation and relationships
- **Confidence levels** indicating certainty about different claims
- **Link relationships** connecting related concepts and documents
- **Version control** for tracking evolution over time

## Reading Guide

### For Quick Overview
Read the first section of each document to understand the overall structure and purpose.

### For Implementation
Focus on documents 2-5 which provide the technical and operational details needed for building systems.

### For Philosophical Understanding
Pay special attention to documents 1 and 6 which articulate the deeper principles and values.

### For AI Agents
The entire bundle is designed to be parseable by AI systems. The structured metadata and explicit uncertainty markers enable AI agents to understand not just the content but the context and confidence levels.

## Self-Demonstrating Structure

This document bundle itself demonstrates the principles it advocates:

- **Coherence:** Each document builds logically on the previous while maintaining thematic unity
- **Adaptation:** Content is structured to serve different reading needs and contexts
- **Stewardship:** Careful attention to preserving context and making uncertainty visible
- **Resilience:** Multiple entry points and cross-references enable graceful navigation

The teaching method embodies the content—showing how to build coherent, relational systems by being one.

## Usage

These documents serve as:
- **Constitution** for the E² project and community
- **Specification** for implementing relational intelligence systems
- **Training material** for AI agents working within the E² framework
- **Reference guide** for developers and researchers
- **Philosophical foundation** for ethical AI development

## Contributing

When contributing to or building upon these documents:

1. Preserve the ORMD format and metadata structure
2. Maintain lineage links to show derivation
3. Be explicit about confidence levels and uncertainty
4. Honor the principles while adapting to new contexts
5. Test changes against the four core values
