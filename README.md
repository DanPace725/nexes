# Nexes - EÂ² Relational Intelligence Platform

> "Slack-for-AI-and-people that thinks with you"

A collaborative intelligence platform where humans and AIs work together as peers, with context that travels, uncertainty that's visible, and knowledge that flows without loss across conversations, documents, and time.

## Project Status: Early Development ðŸš§

This project is in the initial development phase, implementing the vision outlined in our [foundational documentation](./docs/).

## Core Principles

- **Everything exists in relationship** - Our fundamental postulate (EÂ²)
- **Context travels with content** - Meaning doesn't get lost in transmission  
- **Uncertainty is made visible** - Systems acknowledge their limits
- **Knowledge flows without loss** - Across humans, AIs, and hybrid collaborations

## Architecture Overview

### Phase 1: MVP Foundation (Current)
- Basic chat interface with AI integration
- ORMD document creation and editing  
- Context preservation across conversations
- Simple lineage tracking
- Obsidian vault export

### Technology Stack
- **Base Platform**: Rocket.Chat (modified)
- **AI Orchestration**: LangGraph + OpenRouter
- **Knowledge Management**: Obsidian integration
- **Data Layer**: PouchDB/CouchDB (local-first)
- **Formats**: ORMD (Organizational Relational Markdown)

## Getting Started
