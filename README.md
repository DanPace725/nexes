# Nexes - EÂ² Relational Intelligence Platform

> "Slack-for-AI-and-people that thinks with you"

A collaborative intelligence platform where humans and AIs work together as peers, with context that travels, uncertainty that's visible, and knowledge that flows without loss across conversations, documents, and time.

## Project Status: Early Development ðŸš§

This project is in the initial development phase, implementing the vision outlined in our [foundational documentation](./docs/).

## Core Principles

- **Everything exists in relationship** - Our fundamental postulate (EÂ²)
- **Context travels with content** - Meaning doesn't get lost in transmission  
- **Uncertainty is made visible** - Systems acknowledge their limits
- **Knowledge flows without loss** - Across humans, AIs, and hybrid collaborations

## Architecture Overview

### Phase 1: MVP Foundation (Current)
- Basic chat interface with AI integration
- ORMD document creation and editing  
- Context preservation across conversations
- Simple lineage tracking
- Obsidian vault export

### Technology Stack
- **Base Platform**: Rocket.Chat (modified)
- **AI Orchestration**: LangGraph + OpenRouter
- **Knowledge Management**: Obsidian integration
- **Data Layer**: PouchDB/CouchDB (local-first)
- **Formats**: ORMD (Organizational Relational Markdown)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Docker (for development database)
- npm or yarn

### Quick Start

**Using npm (recommended for compatibility):**
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd nexes

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development database
npm run start:mongo

# Build all packages
npm run build:all

# Test ORMD parser
npm run test:ormd

# Run AI handoff tests
npm test --workspace @nexes/ai-handoff
```

**Using yarn (if you have yarn 4.0+):**
```bash
# Same commands, replace 'npm run' with 'yarn'
yarn install
yarn start:mongo
yarn build:all
yarn test:ormd
```

### Run the chat demo

**Using npm:**
```bash
# Build the chat interface
cd packages/chat-interface
npm install
npm run build

# Launch the CLI demo
npm run start
```

**Using yarn workspaces:**
```bash
# Build the chat interface workspace
yarn workspace @nexes/chat-interface build

# Launch the CLI demo
yarn workspace @nexes/chat-interface start
```

The CLI provides conversational tooling for iterative handoffs:

- `/decision` to capture and summarize choices
- `/handoff` to generate ORMD handoff artifacts (see [example output](./HANDOFF_DOCUMENT_2025-09-30.ormd))
- `/export` to bundle the current context for downstream tools

### Current Development Status
